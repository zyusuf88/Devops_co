# Office Network Set up


Network redundancy helps ensure companies can access crucial procedures or information, even if components of their network malfunction. Practical measures need to be undertaken to ensure the network remains in operation for employees and customers. In this office setup I have implemented: 

1. **Modem** -  This component of your network helps your computer and other devices to connect with the internet. This device converts the digital data that the computer understands to analog data that is transmitted over the cable. Fiber optic connection is more commonly used in high data transfer rates
2. **Router** - Transfers data from the internet cable to your device.
3. **Firewall** - A dedicated hardware firewall gives your network a much-needed added layer of protection.  Network infrastructure devices are typical targets for cyber attackers and without a dedicated firewall, your network and all connected devices are vulnerable to hackers.
4. **Switch** -  It is a network device that allows other devices on the network to communicate and share information.
5. **Wireless Access Point** - Simply allows wireless-capable devices to connect to a wired network.
