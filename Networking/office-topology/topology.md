##  &#x2611; Scalability 
- Having a cloud infrastructure to scale up or down resources to meet changing workload demands. It allows businesses to easily **add or remove computing resources** as needed without significant hardware investment or infrastructure changes. 
- This allows businesses to **scale their applications** and services without purchasing and managing physical servers. 
- With the rise of remote work, a secure office network enables employees to access company resources and applications from anywhere, enhancing flexibility and work-life balance.

##  &#x2611; Network redundancy
 - Network redundancy is the process of providing multiple paths for traffic so that data can keep flowing even in the event of a failure.
 - This ensures that the network remains available even if one carrier experiences an outage or disruptions. 
 -  A cloud infrastructure across **multiple geographic regions** ensures that if one region experiences an outage, your services remain available in other regions. 
 - This means that no matter what happens to the physical server, organizations **retain continuity** in the infrastructure without interference unless the physical server goes down â€“ and it then automatically runs on cycle fix.
 - **Automated backup** solutions can help simplify this process and ensure that your data is protected against accidental deletion, corruption, or ransomware attacks.

##  &#x2611; Security  

- A dedicated hardware **firewall** gives your network a much-needed **added layer of protection**. 
-  Network infrastructure devices are typical targets for cyber attackers and without a dedicated firewall, your network and all connected devices are vulnerable to hackers.
- For example, depending on where a firewall is installed, it may guard against insider threats in a network segment or act as a barrier against external threats at the network perimeter.
