# Office Network Set up


Network redundancy helps ensure companies can access crucial procedures or information, even if components of their network malfunction. Practical measures need to be undertaken to ensure the network remains in operation for employees and customers. In this office setup I have implemented: 







##  &#x2611; Scalability 
- Having a cloud infrastructure to scale up or down resources to meet changing workload demands. It allows businesses to easily **add or remove computing resources** as needed without significant hardware investment or infrastructure changes. 
- This allows businesses to **scale their applications** and services without purchasing and managing physical servers. 

##  &#x2611; Network redundancy
 - Network redundancy is the process of providing multiple paths for traffic so that data can keep flowing even in the event of a failure.
 - This ensures that the network remains available even if one carrier experiences an outage or disruptions. 
 - In this office diagram, a **cloud infrastructure** is used that has multiple data centers across multiple continents, and direct “pipes” to the data center for real-time connectivity, backup, and redundancy.
 - This means that no matter what happens to the physical server, organizations **retain continuity** in the infrastructure without interference unless the physical server goes down – and it then automatically runs on cycle fix.

##  &#x2611; Security  

- A dedicated hardware firewall gives your network a much-needed **added layer of protection**. 
-  Network infrastructure devices are typical targets for cyber attackers and without a dedicated firewall, your network and all connected devices are vulnerable to hackers.
- For example, depending on where a firewall is installed, it may guard against insider threats in a network segment or act as a barrier against external threats at the network perimeter.
